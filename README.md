# Binary-Trees-With-Factors
Given an array of unique integers, arr, where each integer arr[i] is strictly greater than 1.  We make a binary tree using these integers, and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of its children.

Input: arr = [2,4]

Output: 3

Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000,
2 <= arr[i] <= 109,
All the values of arr are unique.
